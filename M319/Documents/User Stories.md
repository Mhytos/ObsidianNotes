## [](#introduction)Introduction

User stories are a fundamental part of agile software development, capturing requirements from the end user's perspective. They focus on delivering value and functionality that users need.

## [](#structure)Structure

A typical user story follows the format:

- **As a** [user type]
- **I want** [goal]
- **so that** [reason/benefit]

This format ensures that the story is **user-centric**, **goal-oriented**, and **purpose-driven**.

### [](#example)Example

- **As a** project manager
- **I want** to generate weekly status reports
- **so that** I can keep stakeholders informed about progress.
