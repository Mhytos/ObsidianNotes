In every profession, professionals solve profession-specific _problems_ that are brought to them by customers and clients. In IT and in the field of application development in particular, these problems are usually tasks, processes or services for which _software solutions_ are to be developed, implemented, tested, introduced, operated and maintained.

In order to efficiently and effectively develop the "right software", it is important that software developers understand exactly what the clients want. In practice, this seemingly simple task is usually more difficult than initially assumed and has already led to massive cost overruns and/or even the failure of a project in countless projects.

In addition to a common language for all project participants and proper project management, the initial identification and documentation of all requirements is an essential condition for the success of a software project. The elicitation, formulation, documentation and verification of requirements is an independent discipline ([Requirement Engineering](https://www.jobscout24.ch/de/jobs/requirements%20engineer/)) in the large field of software development.

In order to be able to record and document the requirements for a software, it is urgently necessary to know the wishes, needs, problems and other general conditions of the client. However, since they are usually not software developers or application developers themselves, but experts in their respective fields, no in-depth knowledge in the area of _requirement engineering_ can be assumed from this side. It is therefore the task of the application developers to draw as complete a picture as possible of all requirements using suitable methods and tools.

When formulating requirements, laypersons usually have difficulties separating the _problems_ from the _solutions_. In this case, the client already formulates the software requirements in such a way that the requirements anticipate part of the solution - the _problem_ is thus mixed with the _solution_. Most of the time, this is only _good intention_ on the part of the client - they want to describe to the developers as precisely as possible what they expect from the finished product. However, the fact that alternative solutions and variants can get lost in the process is usually not considered.

**It is therefore urgently necessary that the problem to be worked on is considered _free of solutions_ in a first step.** Only the problem and its context are analysed. Possible solutions are deliberately neglected because they could possibly complicate or limit the prescient and neutral analysis of the problem.

### [](#problem-space)Problem Space

In the problem space, the focus is on the **users** of the solution to be developed for and on the **problem** itself. The sole aim is to better understand the "task" (= the problem) as well as the people who are interested in the solution to the task. Age, previous knowledge, needs, tasks, responsibilities, preferences, and many other aspects of the people using the software could have different influences on the software to be developed later. In addition, the object of the problem must be understood precisely. No matter whether it is a problem from the financial sector, from the agricultural industry, from the education sector or from the machine industry - software developers should understand the processes, terms and framework conditions as well as possible in order to be able to develop the best solution for the analysed problem and the people using it in a subsequent step.

Or to put it briefly: **If you want to find a solution, you first have to inform yourself in detail about the problem.** In this context, the users of the solution to be developed are also part of the problem space.

### [](#solution-space)Solution Space

The solution space is an "imaginary place" where many different approaches to solutions are developed and tested. The rule at the beginning is: the more the better! As many different ideas and approaches as possible should be collected. These do not have to be fully developed. Above all, limitations such as time or budget should not be taken into account in this early phase of finding solutions.

After a broad collection of ideas has emerged, some approaches that seem interesting and/or realistic should be examined more closely, elaborated and possibly tested. For this purpose, so-called _prototypes_ are suitable, which make essential aspects of the solution simplified and schematically tangible. In this way, later users and other stakeholders should be involved in order to receive feedback on the respective solution approach as early as possible.

_here we have an excercise just to look up stuff if i need it_
# Exercise 01: Analysing problems

1. What are possible impacts for the problem space?

> People, companies, geographic space \ Dependent on people: Age, prior knowledge, needs, tasks, responsibilities, responsibilities, preferences

1. If I have an solution idea in the problem space, should I write it down for later? Why yes/no?

> No, it is important to understand all around the problem and its context

1. What should I as a software developer understand in the problem space?

> wishes, needs, problems and other general conditions of the client

1. How does understanding the processes, terms, and framework conditions of a specific industry help software developers?

> It ensures the software fits industry workflows, meets legal standards, and effectively addresses pain points, while enabling clear communication and fostering innovation. Fully understand the wishes and helps to fulfill needs an wishes

1. Why should software developers focus on the users of the solution?

> Focusing on users ensures the software meets their needs, is user-friendly, and provides relevant features, while also allowing for continuous improvement through feedback.

1. Should I focus on one possible solution in the solution space?

> No, the more the better

1. "Time is money": Should I find the solution as fast as possible and develop it?

> Time or budget should not be taken into account

1. How can I show the client some good/interesting approaches?

> Prototypes, Mockups, Videos (combinded with explanations)

1. Should I include the client in the developement process?

> users should be involved in order to receive feedback on the respective solution approach as early as possible.
