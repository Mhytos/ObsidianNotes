# Windows
Windows is the most commonly used operating system worldwide. It has become the standard over the years and it sucks. You have to work with microsofts features and try to get everything to work. But Windows has become the standard in companies due to being a pretty good allrounder for web-, software- and cloud- development.
Windows is also the standard in gaming (have fun trying to get your Nvidia GPU working on a Linux system)
Also Windows is not open source and is more frequently targeted by maleware (I mean its the most used, so ofc hackers are focusing on attacking the os with the most potential victims)

# Linux
Linux is the better and also open source alternative to windows. The main focus lies on the freedom a user has to customize everything about their system (ricing).
It's free to install and to maintain, and you can live with only open source software on your system. A user also has full control over everything

# Mac
Is more similar to Linux than Windows, but sucks just as much as windows.
Is good for graphical stuff, but fuck apple
