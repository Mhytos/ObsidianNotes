1. **PAN/WPAN (Personal Area Network/Wireless PAN)**: Small network, typically for personal devices like smartphones and wearables. WPAN is a wireless version (e.g., Bluetooth).
    
2. **LAN/WLAN/VLAN (Local Area Network/Wireless LAN/Virtual LAN)**:
    
    - **LAN**: Network within a small area like a home or office.
    - **WLAN**: Wireless LAN using Wi-Fi.
    - **VLAN**: Virtual LAN allows logical segmentation of networks within a LAN.
3. **MAN/WAN/GAN (Metropolitan/Wide/Global Area Network)**:
    
    - **MAN**: Covers a city or large campus.
    - **WAN**: Covers a broad area, like different cities or countries (e.g., the Internet).
    - **GAN**: Extends beyond countries, providing global connectivity.
4. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: Secure connection over the internet, often used for accessing resources remotely or maintaining privacy.
    

### Network Topologies:

1. **Bus Topology**: All devices share a single communication line. Simple, but a failure in the line disrupts the whole network.
    
2. **Star Topology**: Devices are connected to a central hub. Reliable since failure of one device doesn't affect others, but if the hub fails, everything goes down.
    
3. **Ring Topology**: Devices are connected in a circular format. Data travels in one direction; failure in one link affects the whole network.
