[[Netzwerkkonzepte]]

---
1. **Repeater**:
    
    - **Functionality**: Amplifies and regenerates signals to extend the range of a network.
    - **Use Case**: Used in situations where network signals need to be boosted over long distances, such as in large buildings or outdoor environments.
2. **Hub**:
    
    - **Functionality**: A basic networking device that connects multiple Ethernet devices and forwards data to all connected devices.
    - **Use Case**: Mostly used in small networks where data collisions are not a significant issue. It is largely obsolete, replaced by switches.
3. **Bridge**:
    
    - **Functionality**: Connects two or more network segments, reducing traffic by dividing the network into separate collision domains.
    - **Use Case**: Used to improve performance by segmenting large networks into smaller, more manageable pieces.
4. **Switch**:
    
    - **Functionality**: A more intelligent version of a hub that forwards data only to the device that needs it, based on MAC addresses.
    - **Use Case**: Commonly used in modern networks to connect multiple devices, reducing collisions and improving performance.
5. **Router**:
    
    - **Functionality**: Connects different networks and directs data packets between them, using IP addresses to determine the best path.
    - **Use Case**: Essential for connecting local networks to the internet and for routing traffic between different subnets.
