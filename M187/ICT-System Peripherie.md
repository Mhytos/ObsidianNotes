- **Monitor:** Displays visual output from the computer. Key specifications include screen size, resolution (e.g., Full HD, 4K), refresh rate, and panel type (e.g., IPS, TN).
- **Keyboard and Mouse:** Input devices for interacting with the computer. Important aspects include connectivity (wired vs. wireless), ergonomics, and additional features like programmable keys or DPI settings for mice.
- **Printer and Scanner:** Devices for producing hard copies of digital content and converting physical documents into digital format, respectively. Key factors include print resolution, speed, color capability, and connectivity options (USB, network, Wi-Fi).
- **Webcam:** Captures video for communication or recording. Important specifications are resolution (e.g., 1080p, 720p), frame rate, and lens quality.
- **Audio Devices (Headset, Microphone, Speakers):** Used for sound input and output. Key factors include sound quality (frequency response, bit rate), noise cancellation, and connectivity.
- **Other Tools:** Additional peripherals such as graphic tablets, external drives, and docking stations, which provide specialized functionalities for specific tasks.

**Objective:** Be able to describe the purpose and key technical aspects of each peripheral, and understand how they integrate with the main ICT system to enhance functionality and user experience.
