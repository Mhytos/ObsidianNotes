- **Notebooks:** Evaluate based on criteria such as processing power (CPU and GPU), portability (weight, battery life), screen quality, and specific features (e.g., touchscreens, 2-in-1 functionality).
- **Printers:** Consider print quality, speed, cost per page, and additional functions (scanning, copying). Choose between inkjet (better for color) and laser (better for text and high-volume).
- **Input Devices (Keyboard, Mouse):** Assess ergonomics, durability, and special features like backlighting or customizable keys.
- **Networking Devices:** Evaluate routers, switches, and other networking equipment based on speed, coverage, and security features.
- **Other Peripherals:** Choose additional devices like external drives, webcams, or docking stations based on user needs for storage, video quality, or connectivity.

**Objective:** Develop the ability to analyze and recommend ICT devices that best match the requirements, considering factors like performance, cost, and user experience.
