- **Processor (CPU):** Choose based on performance needs (e.g., number of cores, clock speed) and compatibility with the motherboard. Consider use cases such as gaming, multitasking, or intensive computing.
- **Cooler (CPU and Case):** Select appropriate cooling solutions to manage heat dissipation. Factors include airflow, noise level, and compatibility with the case and CPU socket.
- **RAM (Memory):** Determine the required capacity and speed (e.g., 8GB DDR4 3200MHz) based on user needs, such as multitasking or handling large datasets.
- **Storage (SSD/HDD):** Choose based on speed and capacity needs. SSDs offer faster read/write speeds, while HDDs provide more storage at a lower cost.
- **Motherboard:** Select a motherboard that supports chosen components (CPU, RAM, storage) and offers required features (e.g., number of ports, expansion slots).
- **Case:** Choose a case that fits all components and provides adequate cooling and expandability.
- **Power Supply (PSU):** Ensure sufficient wattage and reliability to support all components, with considerations for future upgrades.

**Objective:** Be able to select and justify component choices based on system requirements, ensuring balanced performance and compatibility within a given budget and use case.
